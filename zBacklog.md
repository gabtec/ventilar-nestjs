# BACKLOG

[] TO_FIX: on new dev workspace deploy I 1st have to create a ward in database (manually), and then I can use /api/users/register to create admin user (this must be automated)
Use a temp container with plsql to run a script...

[] POST /api/users/register (after 1 admin is register the route gets unavailable)
[] replace bcrypt with argon2id for tokens generation/signing

[] exemplo com argon2 tokens
